# Mersenne Unit Testing


Automated Testing

=== Writing code, to test that your code works.

Manual Testing 

=== Clicking and poking around and seeing if it works.

Benefits of testing
- Automate the manual stuff, potentially saving time.
- Risk mitigation
    - Lower the risk of deployment
    - Makes deployment cheaper, easier, less scary. 
    - Checkmark dopamine rush

Costs of testing
- Takes a while to write

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Write tests firsts
Watch them fail
Fix them

Works really well if you understand the technical scope of what your building.
